# GEM3
##GEM software suite
This software suite contains several methods for analyzing transcription factor binding and motif using genomic data (GEM, GPS, KMAC, KSM, RMD, etc.) and for discovering chromatin interactions (CID).<br>
The complied Java software can be downloaded from http://groups.csail.mit.edu/cgs/gem/versions.html.<br>
The orignal research papers can be found on the web pages of the individual tools.
